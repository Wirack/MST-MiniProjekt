% Background
New ideas are always emerging in the field of technology.
One relatively recent idea is cloud computing, which at its simplest is the idea that computing services can be handled remotely outside of the computer. 
The general idea as mentioned is to offload computer services from being handled locally to being handled remotely. 
This could for example be to use the computation power of the cloud, or the storage capability of the cloud as that might be more efficient or effective than to have it handled locally because those resources might be constrained.

Another fairly recent idea is mobile computing, where a computer is moved around during usage.
The most prominent example of this that is in widespread use is a smartphone.
Because mobile computers need to be transportable they are significantly smaller than other computers and this comes with the consequence that there is a limited amount of resources available for use, e.g less store space or less processing power.
Which is where Mobile Cloud Computing or MCC comes into the picture. 
MCC is where you extend the idea of cloud computing to mobile devices.
% Definition af MCC
One definition for the term MCC is given by \citet{article:mobilecloudreviewinderkildesecurity}:

\textit{"Mobile Cloud Computing at its simplest, refers to an infrastructure where both the data storage and the data processing happen outside of the mobile device. Mobile cloud applications move the computing power and data storage away from mobile phones and into the cloud, bringing applications and mobile computing to not just smartphone users but a much broader range of mobile subscribers"}

% Motivation - Hvorfor er emnet interessant? hvad f√•r man ud af at bruge det? hvordan ser emnet ud overordnet set?
MCC is interesting because using it means you can avoid intrinsic issues on mobile devices and thus provide a better experience for the user. 
These issues are that the resources on mobile devices can be very resource constrained, e.g not a lot of storage space or not a lot of computation power.
MCC addresses these problems by offloading mobile applications to external resource providers, \citet{fernando2013mobile}.

% Meta om hvordan vores survey er organiseret
As \citet{6215350} mentions, mobile cloud computing is still at an early stage of development and the purpose of this survey is to examine MCC. 
We examine what types of clouds you can encounter in MCC.
We also go into what kinds of services are available and what they can be used for, for example Software as a Service.
Additionally we cover which frameworks and architectures have been built. 
Furthermore, there are issues that should be discussed such as how data communication is handled and what kind of trust and security MCC has. 
Finally, open research challenges in the area are also discussed.
