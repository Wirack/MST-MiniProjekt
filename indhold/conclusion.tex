To conclude, mobile cloud computing is a research area with extreme growth.
It is useful to delegate computational and storage concerns from mobile devices to cloud solutions.
This is useful as mobile devices have limited resources in that regard, e.g. storage, battery life, and computational power.
Various state of the art solutions exist, but a wide range of problems still exists to be dealt with.
We find the area interesting, and it is worth to keep in mind when developing mobile solutions.
