There are three common services that clouds provide.
\begin{description}[style=nextline]
\item[Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)]
Where an entire infrastructure is provided to the customer.
This includes, hardware, software, and storage that the customer rents \citep{article:mobilecloudreviewinderkilde}.
With this, the customer is able to run an arbitrary range of software that can include operating systems \citep{misc:indersuverymcc}.
Examples of IaaS systems are Amazon Elastic Cloud Computing \citep{misc:amazonelastic} and DigitalOcean \citep{misc:digitalocean}.

\item[Platform as a Service (PaaS)]
This can be thought of as a service market for the customer.
You get a predefined completed platform provided, which may include operating system, database, and webserver \cite{article:mobilecloudreviewinderkilde}.
In that way you lower the customizability of your service, and is limited to use the tools provided by the service.
You are still able to host your own applications, though, if such a feature is provided.

In that way the view is a bit different from IaaS, where you pick a platform and customize it with tools to fit your needs.
If you decide to use a PaaS service, you have some tools you want to utilize and pick a platform provider that fits your need of tools.

A few examples of PaaS are \citet{misc:appFog} and \citet{misc:heroku}.

\item[Software as a Service (SaaS)]
With the SaaS approach, you limit the scope even more.
In such a scenario, the service provides some given software that you can use.
This ensures that you don't have to install the Software on your own system, but can instead utilize something already installed elsewhere \citep{article:mobilecloudreviewinderkilde,misc:indersuverymcc}. 

Examples of such software hosted on a SaaS are Dropbox and Google Docs \citep{article:mobilecloudreviewinderkildesecurity}.

In that way, the customer have different alternatives to which service types they want to use.
Common to all of them is that they delegate computation and storage concerns from the customer's own device, to some rented service in the cloud.

Does the customer need a full scale customizable service, somewhere in between, or merely want to do text editing without having software installed on his device?
These are just some of the choices a costumer have to consider.
