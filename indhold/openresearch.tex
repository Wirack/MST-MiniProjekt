%Energy Saving - Bad connection = More energy - Small computations + Cloud = More Energy
When having to calculate heavy computations on a mobile phone can be very energy consuming.
By using MCC, you might think that you are able to reduce this.
However, this is not always the case.
One case where this it can be much more energy consuming to calculate it on the cloud is when you are having low cost computations \citep{goyalmobile,liu2013gearing,fernando2013mobile}.
The reason why this is much more energy consuming is because it cost a lot of energy to send data through the internet, but also to receive new data.
Furthermore, if you are having a bad internet connection it is also more energy consuming to send data and receive it \citep{goyalmobile,liu2013gearing,fernando2013mobile}.
It is therefore important to consider when it is profitable to send data through the internet before doing so.

\subsection{Privacy}
%Privacy
Due to mobile devices usually are being used as a personal device, privacy is an important factor for the users of a MCC system.
As \citet{liu2013gearing, fernando2013mobile} describes it, many users are having private information on their mobile devices, which the users does not want to be spread all of the internet.
Therefore, it is important that the users are able to see what type of data that are shared and to be able to choice which data that should be shared with the MCC system, as mentioned in \citet{sanaei2014heterogeneity}.
However, sometimes the MCC system must have access to a certain type of data, and in this case the user would have to trust the system \citep{fernando2013mobile}.

\subsection{Quality of Internet Connection}
%Quality of communication
As mention in section \ref{EnergySaving} the quality of the internet connection can be an important factor.
However, this quality also have other consequences, which is delay.
As mention in \citep{fernando2013mobile} the delay can be as high as 680ms on a 3G network.
The reason why this delay is so high is because the mobile device is far away from the internet provider, but also because the connection have to move through the air instead of a cable.
When connecting through a wireless connection many things can have an impact, for example due the weather\citep{dev2014review,kumar2013mobile}
The delay can have a negative impact on the experience when using an application, because it can be very frustrating for the user to wait a long time on a result \citep{hazarika2014mobile}.
