We perform a survey in the topic of mobile cloud computing.

Mobile cloud computing is interesting as it enables new possibilities for mobile devices to delegate work to resource heavy cloud solutions.
By doing this, increased battery life and computational power, as well as a reduction of storage requirements, can be achieved. 

We cover the areas of types of clouds, types of services, frameworks and architectures, trust and security, as well as open research challenges.
By reading the survey, you gain a brief insight in what state of the art solutions exist as well as a taste on where the research is going.
