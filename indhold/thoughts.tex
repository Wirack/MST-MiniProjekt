We find MCC an interesting topic that provides many new possibilities in its area.
This is supported by the vast amount of research in the area of MCC.
We present our ideas of use contexts in which MCC can be utilized.

One idea is using MCC at events where there are a lot of people gathered small space which results in a lot of bandwidth being used.
Examples of such events are Roskilde Festival \citep{misc:roskilde} and Karneval in Aalborg \citep{misc:karneval}.
This gathering of many people with mobile devices can mitigate the lack of bandwidth and brings the relevance of applications such as:

\begin{itemize}
	\item People with poor connections could leverage an ad hoc network and get a better connection.
	\item An ad hoc network could be used as a kind of super computer, which also might remedy loss of connection to the cloud.
	\item People could use an ad hoc network to find each other, e.g. triangulation with Wi-Fi or use of Wi-Fi fingerprinting. 
	\item Downloading content through Peer-to-Peer, where people that want the same content could download parts of it and share it over the network with the other people that want it. This could save bandwidth on the download site, and put it on the network instead.
\end{itemize}

These ideas need to be researched further but is out of the scope of this survey, which serves as an overview of MCC.
