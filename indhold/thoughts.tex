We find MCC an interesting topic that provides many new possibilities in its area.
This is supported by the vast amount of research in the area of MCC.
We present our ideas of use contexts in which MCC can be utilized.

One idea is using MCC at events where there are a lot of people that necessarily result in a lot of bandwidth being used.
This could for example be at Roskilde Festival\citep{misc:roskilde} or Karneval in Aalborg \citep{misc:karneval}.
This could be used for several different things, such as:

\begin{itemize}
	\item People with poor connections could leverage an ad hoc network and get a better connection.
	\item An ad hoc network could be used as a kind of super computer.
	\item People could use an ad hoc network to find each other. 
	\item Downloading content through Peer-to-Peer, where people that want the same content could download parts of it and share it over the network with the other people that want it. This could save bandwidth on the download site, and put it on the network instead.
\end{itemize}

These ideas of course need to be researched further, but it is a preview of where MCC could be used.
